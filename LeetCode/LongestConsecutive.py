'''

Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
Output: 9
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,0,1,2]
Output: 3
 

Constraints:

0 <= nums.length <= 105
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109

        numSet, longest = set(nums), 1
        # print(numSet)
        for n in numSet:
            if (n-1) not in numSet:
                seq = 1
                while (n+seq) in numSet:
                    seq += 1
                longest = seq if seq>longest else longest
        return longest
